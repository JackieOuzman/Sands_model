## Outline of model
"Sands"" is economic tool, which evaluates and ranks soil ameliorants options for farms with soil constraints.

##Ameliorants considered in the sands model

The managemnet options to consider include.
![strategies](strategies.png){ width=80% } 


(note the images needs to be in the same folder as the rMrakdown shiny for this to render).

The organic inputs is an umberella term which covers manure, composts and residues (as the project never compare them at a single location).

This is a lot to consider 32 option without including the 'other tillage option'.
I think this will need to be capped, there is no way one farmer can consider all of these options.
##I will need help on what contrasts are sensiable and which are not.

For more information and the full list is on my drive at:

##Sites considered in the sands model

  ![*Map of sand sites*](map_sites.png){ width=80% }

The site is selected from the user and this will modify the app.

```{r jaxs2, echo=FALSE}

selectInput("stationID", label = "Select sites for anlaysis:",
              choices = c("Waikerie", "Carwarp","Ouyen", "Karoonda", "Murlong", "Yenda", "Lameroo", "Bute", "Brimpton Lake", "Cadgee"), selected = "Waikerie")
```

Selecting the site will mean that:

* Weather file will be used
* Range of yield potentails will be use
* check to see if the costing will change

By choosing the site a met file will become avaliable.

![*List of sites and met stations used*](met_sites.png){ width=80% }

The met data is daily patch point data from start of 1960  to end of 2017.
We have a few options on how the app uses met data;

* we could downlaod the files first and make access the data before the shiny app is used.
This makes the shiny app more efficient.
* Alternative method would be to call them from the site (http://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo)

The idea here is that when you select a station the below script runs and gets rainfall data
from SILO

```{r function to import met file, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}

#install.packages("RCurl")
library(RCurl)

getSiloMet_jax <- function(stationID = NULL) {
 
  #check my apiKey it is Kvsj6LwGthiRRUoxGazEDLikHvDxh5kOJDvbRZp4
  startDate <- paste('01011960',sep='')
  finishDate <- paste('12312017',sep='')
  
  
  siloUrl <- 'https://siloapi.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/pointdata'
  siloUrl <- paste(siloUrl, '?apikey=','Kvsj6LwGthiRRUoxGazEDLikHvDxh5kOJDvbRZp4', sep='')
  siloUrl <- paste(siloUrl,'&format=CSV', sep='')
  siloUrl <- paste(siloUrl,'&station=',sprintf('%05d', stationID), sep='')
  siloUrl <- paste(siloUrl,'&start=', startDate, sep='')
  siloUrl <- paste(siloUrl,'&finish=', finishDate, sep='')
  siloUrl <- paste(siloUrl,'&variables=daily_rain,max_temp,min_temp', sep='')
  
  print(siloUrl)
  
  dataUrl <- getURL(siloUrl)
  
  csvDat <- read.csv(textConnection(dataUrl),stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
  
  return(csvDat)
}


##I am getting no data back but I think something is wrong with the website
# my python script is not working either

```


For the monent I think it is best to download the datasets first.
But this can be changed if needed.

```{r making use of met file}

rainfall <- read_table2("met_file_template24018.txt", 
                        skip = 35)

rainfall_1 <- select(rainfall_1, Date, Day, Rain, Date2)
rainfall_1$Date3 <- as.Date(rainfall_1$Date2, "%d/%m/%Y")
rainfall_1$Rain <- as.double(rainfall_1$Rain)
#Create new clm month and year
rainfall_1$Month <- as.Date(rainfall_1$Date2, "%d/%m/%Y")
rainfall_1$Year <- as.Date(rainfall_1$Date2, "%d/%m/%Y")

rainfall_1$Month <- months.Date(rainfall_1$Month)
rainfall_1$Year <- year(rainfall_1$Year)
#create new clm that is month and year
rainfall_1$Month_Yr <- as.character(rainfall_1$Date3, format="%b-%Y")
#recode the months into summer rainfall or GS rainfall
rainfall_1$rain_season <- recode(rainfall_1$Month , "January" = "summer",
